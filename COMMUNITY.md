# Ferrite Community

Welcome to the Ferrite community! 🦀

Ferrite is a high-performance, tiered-storage key-value store built in Rust — designed as a drop-in Redis replacement that keeps your data hot in memory and warm on disk, so you get Redis-level speed without Redis-level memory bills.

Whether you're a seasoned Rust developer or just getting started with databases, there's a place for you here.
