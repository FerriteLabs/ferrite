# Contributor Ladder

Welcome to the Ferrite contributor ladder! This document describes the path from first-time contributor to maintainer. Each level recognizes increasing responsibility and trust within the project.

## Level 1: Contributor

- Made at least 1 merged PR
- Listed in CONTRIBUTORS.md
- Gets "contributor" label on GitHub

**How to reach this level:** Pick a [good first issue](./good-first-issues.md), submit a PR that follows our [contributing guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md), and get it merged.

## Level 2: Regular Contributor

- Made 5+ merged PRs across at least 2 areas (e.g., different crates, docs, tests)
- Demonstrated understanding of codebase conventions (formatting, error handling, testing)
- Can be assigned to review PRs (advisory, not blocking)

**How to reach this level:** Keep contributing quality PRs. Show that you understand Ferrite's architecture and coding standards. Engage in code reviews and issue discussions.

## Level 3: Committer

- Made 10+ merged PRs
- Demonstrated expertise in at least one crate (e.g., `ferrite-core`, `ferrite-search`)
- Granted write access to specific crate(s)
- Can approve and merge PRs in their area
- Expected to review PRs within their area of expertise

**How to reach this level:** Sustained, high-quality contributions focused on a specific area. Existing maintainers will invite you when they see consistent expertise and good judgment.

## Level 4: Maintainer

- Sustained contributions over 3+ months
- Demonstrated architectural judgment across multiple subsystems
- Full write access to all repos in the FerriteLabs organization
- Can make release decisions
- Participates in roadmap planning and governance

**How to reach this level:** Maintainer status is granted by existing maintainers through consensus. It reflects deep trust in both technical ability and project stewardship.

## Notes

- Levels are guidelines, not rigid gates. Exceptional contributors may advance faster.
- Inactivity does not revoke levels, but write access may be adjusted for security.
- All contributors are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
